# Innoviz assigment:

    Sign detection and classification by point cloud.
    Algorithm is tested on provided data and simuations.

    By Sergey Sinitsa

### Provided materials:

 - Python files:
    - main.py
    - algorithms.py
    - io_utils.py
    - lin_alg.py
 - Jupiter notebook innoviz_solution.ipynb
 - Solution overview innoviz_solution_overview.pdf
 - Data files in "Objects" directory:
   - Provided cluster cluster_2.csv
   - Simulated data:
      - Directory rot_x
      - Directory rot_z
      - Directory straight
      - Each directory contains four files: pole.ply, square.ply, triangle.ply, circle.ply
   
### Instructions:

   1. Extract files
   2. Set python > 3.8 environment according to requirements.txt
   3. To test on provided data run main.py either from terminal or IDE
   4. To run test on provided and simulated data there is also Jupiter notebook.
      1. It is already pre runned, therefore results will show up automatically.
      2. You may additionally re run it as specified within the notebook.
